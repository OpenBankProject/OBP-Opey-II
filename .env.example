# OBP API MODE dictates Opey's tool calling behaviour with respect to the Open Bank Project API

#   NONE: Opey cannot call the OBP API at all.
#   SAFE: Opey can only make GET requests to OBP API, these do not need to be approved by the user
#   DANGEROUS: Opey can make any request to OBP API, including POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. These requests will be approved by the user
#   TEST: Opey can make any request to OBP API, including POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. These requests will not wait for user approval.
#
# ONLY USE TEST MODE ON A OBP TEST SANDBOX OR YOU RISK LOSING DATA
# For most cases, DANGEROUS is the best option, as it allows Opey to make any request to OBP API, including POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. These requests will be approved by the user
# use SAFE mode if you want to limit Opey's access to the OBP API, and only allow it to make GET requests i.e. on API Explorer II
